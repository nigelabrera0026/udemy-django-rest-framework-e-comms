IMPORTANT NOTES
- The dev environment I am working on is Bash
- Always check version of packages, especially
  if replicating a project.

- Project folder - means the project that contains the whole project
- main project folder - means the django project folder usually pertains when
                        you initialized the django project using django-admin


*** Creating a virtual env for python

$ python3 -m venv venv

# python3: This specifies that Python 3
            should be used to execute the following command.

# -m venv: This tells Python to use the venv module,
            which is a module that comes with Python for
            creating virtual environments.

# venv: This is the name of the directory
        where the virtual environment will be created.
        It's common to name this directory venv as well,
        but you could name it anything you like.

# Activating the env.
$ source venv/bin/activate

# Deactivating the env.
(Make sure you are at least in the root of the proj.)
$ deactivate
